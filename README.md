I'm honestly still trying to figure out what should go in a readme.

Even though we had to create all of our objects manually, I think I have my naming conventions and format in such a way that should make it easy to generalize them with a few arrays and a for loop. I think?

Started picking out a color scheme for the outwards-facing page, next thing I want to do is get a layout in my head for what goes on the page below the fish, and I want to figure out how to design a footer that stays at the bottom of the window as you scroll up and down.
